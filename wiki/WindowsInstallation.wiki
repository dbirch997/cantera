These installation instructions are for Cantera 2.1.1.

= Installing Cantera 2.1 for Windows =

  # *Choose your Python version and architecture*
    * On Windows, Cantera supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.3. Python 3.3 is recommended unless you need to use legacy code that does not work with Python 3.
    * Cantera supports both 32- and 64- bit Python installations.
    * You need choose the matching Cantera installer for your Python version and machine architecture.
    * The rest of these instructions will refer to your chosen version of Python as *X.Y*.
    * If you are using Matlab, you must use the same architecture for Cantera and Matlab. Matlab defaults to 64-bit if you are running a 64-bit operating system.
  # *Install Python*
    * Go to [http://python.org/download/ python.org].
    * *64-bit*: Download the most recent "Python X.Y Windows X86-64 MSI Installer"
    * *32-bit*: Download the most recent "Python X.Y Windows x86 MSI Installer"
    * Run the installer. The default installation options should be fine.
    * Python is required in order to work with `.cti` input files even if you are not using the Python interface to Cantera.
  # *Install Numpy*
    * *64-bit*: Go to the [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages] page.
    * *32-bit*: Go to the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/ NumPy download page].
    * Download the most recent release of the 1.x series for Python X.Y.
    * Run the installer.
  # *Remove old versions of Cantera*
    * Use The Windows "Add/Remove Programs" interface
    * Remove both the main Cantera package and the Python module.
    * The Python module will be listed as "Python X.Y Cantera ..."
  # *Install Cantera*
    * Go to the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/cantera/files/cantera/2.1.1/ Cantera Downloads] page.
    * *64-bit*: Download *`Cantera-2.1.1-x64.msi`* and *`Cantera-Python-2.1.1-x64-pyX.Y.msi`*.
    * *32-bit*: Download *`Cantera-2.1.1-x86.msi`* and *`Cantera-Python-2.1.1-x86-pyX.Y.msi`*.
    * If you are only using the Python module, you do not need to download and install the base package.
    * Run the installer(s).
  # *Configure Matlab* (optional)
    * Set the environment variable `PYTHON_CMD`
      * Right-click _My Computer_, select _Properties_
      * Go to the _Advanced_ tab.
      * Select _Environment Variables_.
      * Add a _New_ variable with `PYTHON_CMD` as the _name_ and the full path to the Python executable (e.g. `c:\python27\python.exe`) as the _value_.
      * Setting `PYTHON_CMD` is not necessary if the path to `python.exe` is in your `PATH` (which can be set from the same configuration dialog).
    * Launch Matlab
    * Go to _File->Set Path..._
    * Select _Add with Subfolders_
    * Browse to the folder `c:\Program Files\Cantera\matlab\toolbox`
    * Select _Save_, then _Close_.
  * *Test the installation*
    * Python:
{{{
import cantera
gas = cantera.Solution('gri30.cti')
h2o = cantera.PureFluid('liquidvapor.cti', 'water')
}}}
    * Matlab:
{{{
gas = IdealGasMix('gri30.cti')
h2o = importPhase('liquidvapor.cti','water')
}}}
